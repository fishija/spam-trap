# Pristine spam trap system

The program presents a (kind of) theoretical approach to pristine spam traps. Furthermore, this application can be used as a tool for detecting and removing emails from undesirable senders.

Pristine spam traps are specially created email addresses designed solely for capturing spam. Messages received on them are automatically recognized as unwanted and likely spam. This project allows for the analysis of spam, identification of patterns, and trends.
